    <h2>Background:</h2> 
    <p>My names are Maduh Chibuike Justin,  Frontend Engineering student of AltSchool Africa with student ID ALT/SOE/024/0951. A native of Ahizau Mbaise Imo state, Nigeria.</p>
    <h2>Education:</h2>
    <p>I had my basic education (Nur/Primary) in Owerri Imo state. I attended the glorious Goverment College Owerri for my secondary education where I performed excellently well in my West Africa Examination Council (WAEC) after which I got admitted into Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO). I proceeded to Kuala Lumpur Malaysia where I bagged another BSc in Business Administration, International Business major with Second Class Upper Honours. Again, I proceeded to Federal University of Technology Owerri (FUTO) for an MBA in Project Management Technology.</p>
<h2>Family:</h2>
<p>
    I came from a middle income civil servant family of 8. The third child of six children, two girls and four boys. The first of the four boys.
</p>
<h2>Work:</h2>
<p>
    I started my work life as an Intern with the now defunct Bank PHB. Worked with Ray Resources Bhd Malaysia as Logistics Officer for a year before my return back to Nigeria where I started my own company Putra Global Service Ltd.

</p>
<h2>Hobbies:</h2>
<p>
    I enjoy traveling, Driving, Football, Movies (Action&Horror),Reading. 
</p>

<h2>Why I Joined AltSchool:</h2>
<p>
    I have always be fascinated by the internet and computers. I believed things can be done differently and better. Maybe I have a gift of seeing things differently so it has always been easy for me to figure out problems or issues especially when I use Mobile Apps or Websites and I get fascinated by how they re built and how to make it better. More importantly, I needed to upskill as the world and work environment is constantly changing and moving towards technological skills. I want to  be a part of this community that will build something for the next generation.
</p>
<h2>Goals for School of Engineering:</h2>
<p>
    To be a part of the success story of AltSchool Africa and a world class developer.
